## Description:
This application was designed to serve as a back-end for an e-commerce website, enabling back-end users access to a customisable database for their merchandise - with database features including categories, products & tags.
For each of the aforementioned features, you are able to:
- View items by feature
- View single item by feature ID
- Add new item of that feature (e.g. a new category)
- Update name of an item of that feature (e.g. update a category's name)
- Delete an item of that feature (e.g. delete a category)

## Installation:
To use this application, you will need to:
- Install an API Development Platform, such as Insomnia (this was the platform used in the demos seen in this README.)
- install Node.js
- Ensure you have a Terminator emulator Software installed (such as Terminal for Mac, or Bash for Windows). 

Before running the code, it is important to run 'npm i' in your terminal, to ensure all packages are transferred to your machine.

## Usage:
- Open the folder 'E-Commerce-Back-End/Develop' in your terminal, then type 'npm i' to ensure all packages are working on your machine.
- Next, clone the .env.example file, renaming the file '.env' and fill out your server credentials.
Type /npm run seed' into the terminal to set up the starter tables and database.
- Then, type 'npm start' to launch the server.
- Next, navigate to your API Development Platform and enter your desired routes. To view the routes, navigate to the relevant files in the routes/api folder (e.g. category-routes.js).
